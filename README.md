# smart_vending_machine
A fully functional Verilog-based vending machine designed using a Finite State Machine (FSM). Supports three product options (₹25, ₹50, ₹75), handles overpayment with change return, detects underpayment, and allows multiple consecutive purchases. Includes a comprehensive testbench and timing-accurate waveform validation.

This project implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)-based Smart Vending Machine** using Verilog HDL. It simulates real-world vending operations including multi-product selection, payment verification, change return, transaction cancellation, and wallet handling.

## Designed, simulated, and tested using **AMD Vivado Design Suite**.
## Features
- 3 product options: ₹25, ₹50, ₹75
- Compares inserted money with product price
- Dispenses product if money is sufficient
- Returns change
- Displays `insufficient` signal if funds are low
